# ETN school 2023 - PEPS tutorial

1. Classical 2D Ising model - contracting the partition function with CTMRG
2. Optimization of spin-1/2 2D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice with single-site iPEPS

Using [peps-torch](https://github.com/jurajHasik/peps-torch):

3. Specific PEPS: S=2 AKLT state and spin-1/2 nearest-neighbour resonating valence bond state 
4. Simple update for spin-1/2 2D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with 2x2 unit cell
